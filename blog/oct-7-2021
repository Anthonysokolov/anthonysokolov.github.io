i took a little break from the site.
its funny how losing a little rythm can go a long way,
and how easy it is to create when in flow.
been busy with school and new internship,
took on maybe too much this fall;
but i'll be done with school soon.
at the tail end of my schooling i've learned the most from my own explorations, trials, and errors.
some theoretical content in my classes has been quite fruitful, but most of it is a poor use of time at best. in practice, practice comes before theory. theory allows us to make sense of things we experience after the fact. i've had several friends ask how i'm able to learn so many different skills; simply put, when something excites me and tingles my senses i'll dive right in and focus on making something happen. when i focus too much on meeting arbitrary benchmarks i get stressed and discouraged.
in other news, getting much better with react and js. wanna give my site an overhaul but gotta figure out a backend for content management.
