hello friends, including those with whom I haven't had the pleasure of acquaintance.
I'll be expanding upon my site over the next while, my vision is to have this as the central hub for my journies. I'll be writing about some old adventures from my teens, my current explorations, and crafting showcases for the works I craete. 
Currently I am at home enjoying the last few weeks of summer. I wrapped up a summer internship recently so now I have plenty of time to spend as I please. 
I've been spending lots of time on the DJ decks, finding my rhythm and having loads of fun. I'm hoping to have a mix of some hard hitting techno out soon. I'm generally excited with how things are moving on that frontier. I've been catching plenty of shows over the summer and am hoping to throw a party of my own in the coming months. 
At a major inflection point right now, wrapping up school and moving out on my own are top of mind. If you are reading these words looks like you are along for the ride!
