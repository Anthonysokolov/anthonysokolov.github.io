so i finally figured out how to get text files to populate on here. seems simple enough but it took me a number of tries to get it to work properly. And now i need to work on actually having some nice formatting on the site. Honestly i've never dove too deep into frontend / web design, so i was feeling some resistance trying to get into gear and develop.
but now im there!
had a fun time this weekend, was out in ridgewood with my sister for her last wekend in ny. good vibes on the dancefloor at nowadays, i felt like i was in tron with all the fog and flashing lights.
i'm finally coming to realize the merit of twitter, its nice being able to find like minded ppl my same age. I can just broadcast whats on my mind and whoever wants can connect with me on that.
preparing for school now, but i'm way too over it. the whole paradigm around education in the us is mostly inneffective. putting theory before practice is never the way when we are concerned with true pursuits of knowledge. we learn by doing and can reflect on our experiences after the fact to obtain theoretical understandings. not to mention we condition youth to memorize things just to optimize a singular metric called a grade. what is done with that knowledge beyond that is usually not considered. think of it this way, is the initializion script that we've created for members of our society really any good? if we want to maximize the number of obedient workers then maybe it is...
about to sign an offer for full time employment in the next few days, life is coming at me fast these days. blessed to be where i am but im bothered by the fluff (inefficencies) that dominate corporate landscapes. another reason why web3 calls my name, evidently i haven't fully committed to that world yet.
