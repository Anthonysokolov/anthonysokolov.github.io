I love a cool summer night, this heat wave has finally caught a break today.
About to leave to go to basement, excited to see the renowned techno tomb of queens. DVS1 is playing and i expect some incredibles vibes on the decks.
I'm just bracing myself, should be quite the night. Just got around to minting my first NFTs. They're currently on ethereum but the gas fees are proving unusable. I'm not too much a fan of centralized
solutions such as bsc or matic, but i'd be open to checking out other platforms on tezos, dag, and cardano. Seems i may need to wait a bit for cardano and constellation though. I'm really enjoying the dive into this, i have some ideas brewing and who knows where the road may lead.
Life is defined by uncertainty I must remind myself.
Last thing, I'll be playing my first gig in brooklyn next month, SEP 22 at 1030 i'll be spinning some of my fav tracks at Eris. I'm still making the mood board but expect some ravey vibes, but chilled out to a wednesday night atmosphere.
