there's a storm coming. kinda looking forward to it, just a lazy day at home. I can take it slow and devote some time to learning something new. I've been getting pretty into solidity later, its a new paradigm of programming for me so its real interesting to learn. Eth is a major game changer but i also don't want to lose sight of other solutions for creating decentralized apps. Eth or not, web3 is surely the way of the future.
what to do about the oceans rising? seems so far away when one has the luxury of looking elsewhere. maybe nyc will be flooded, how do we act today knowing that possibility? do we really need all that energy we use as a society? i'm betting we could easily do better should we really feel the pressure. but the thought of profits and the tragedy of the commons leaves me not so optimistic. first and foremost we need leaders who have skin in the game when it comes to life many decades out, not the decaying excuses of decision makers occupying the top spots in dc.
On another note i just put out a new dj mix, i'm feeling pretty good about it. I've been getting back into my groove and refueling my creative spirit. I forget just how effortless it can feel when i am fully tapped in to the process.
